# Events

This area tracks events, appointments, and calendar items. Events are managed in the app with proper date handling and can be exported to ICS format for calendar integration.

## Categories

- **50.01** - Local Events (concerts, festivals, community events)
- **50.02** - Travel & Trips (vacations, flights, trips)
- **50.03** - Appointments (doctor, dentist, meetings)
- **50.04** - Holidays & Celebrations (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries)

## Usage

Events are best managed through the `/events` page in the app, which provides:
- Calendar-style date display
- ICS export for syncing with external calendars
- Upcoming/past filtering
- Category-based organization

## Date Format

Following Johnny.Decimal best practices:
- Dates use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-12-25`)
- Times use 24-hour format: `HH:MM` (e.g., `14:00`)
- All-day events omit time component

## Calendar Integration

Export events via `/api/events?format=ics` to import into:
- Apple Calendar
- Google Calendar
- Outlook
- Any ICS-compatible calendar app
