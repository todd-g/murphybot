# Events

This area tracks events, appointments, and calendar items. Events are managed in the app with proper date handling and can be exported to ICS format for calendar integration.

## Categories

- **50.01** - Local Events (concerts, festivals, community events)
- **50.02** - Travel & Trips (vacations, flights, trips)
- **50.03** - Appointments (doctor, dentist, meetings)
- **50.04** - Holidays & Celebrations (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries)

## Inline Event Syntax

Events can be written directly in any note and will be **automatically extracted** to the calendar. Use this format:

```
📅 Event: Title | YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM | Location
```

### Examples

```
📅 Event: Dentist Appointment | 2025-12-15 | 14:00 | Dr. Smith's Office
📅 Event: Christmas Dinner | 2025-12-25 | 18:00 | Grandma's House
📅 Event: School Holiday | 2025-12-23
```

### Rules
- **Date is required** in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Time is optional** (24-hour format HH:MM)
- **Location is optional**
- Separate fields with `|` (pipe character)
- One event per line
- Events sync to calendar every 5 minutes

## Usage

Events are best managed through the `/events` page in the app, which provides:
- Calendar-style date display
- ICS export for syncing with external calendars
- Upcoming/past filtering
- Category-based organization
- Manual event creation (for events without notes)

## Calendar Integration

Export events via `/api/events?format=ics` to import into:
- Apple Calendar
- Google Calendar
- Outlook
- Any ICS-compatible calendar app
